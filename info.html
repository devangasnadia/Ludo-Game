            <h2>Informaton regarding the game</h2>
            <p>Snakes and ladders is a board game for two or more players regarded today as a worldwide classic. </p>
                <p> A number of "ladders" and "snakes" are pictured on the board, each connecting two specific </p>
                <p> board squares.The object of the game is to navigate one's game piece, according to die rolls,</p>
                <p> from the start (bottom square) to the finish (top square), helped by climbing ladders but hindered</p>
                <p> by falling down snakes. </p>
            <h2>How to Play the game</h2>
            <p>Each player starts with a token on the starting square</p>
            <p>Players take turns rolling a single die to move their token by the number of squares indicated by the die rolled</p>
            <p> If, on completion of a move, a player's token lands on the lower-numbered end of a "ladder", the player moves the token up to the ladder's higher-numbered square.</p>
            <p>If the player lands on the higher-numbered square of a "snake" (or chute), the player moves the token down to the snake's lower-numbered square.</p>
            <h2>Tips</h2>
            <p>1. Strategize to get the ladders in order to keep your player safe from snakes.</p>
            <p>2. Be aware of the locations of the snakes.</p>
            <p>3. Try to get your opponent to land on snakes in order to increase your chancs to win</p>
